//Lazy- Makes sure that the instance should not be allocated immediately when the function that returns it is called,
//but just when its values are used.This is made to avoid a situation that a variable is initialized but never used,
//and wastes resources unnecessarily.

//Threadsafe- To avoid a situation that two threads will access an instance together and then it will be allocated twice.
//When accessing an instance we lock it until we finish with it.By doing so, if two threads try accessing an instance together
//the first one will enter and lock the instance, the second one will wait until the first one will finish and only when the
//first one finished with the instance and releases it, the second one will have access to there, then it'll see that the 
//instance is initialized and will use it.
